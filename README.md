## Description

This iOS application, developed with Swift and SwiftUI, simulates a session management system for "Nature Walks" where users can view, mark as favorite, and share different sessions. The app provides functionalities to log in, view all available sessions, manage a list of favorite sessions, and view session details. Additionally, users can share sessions via other apps and remove favorite sessions either individually or all at once. This project showcases modern iOS development practices, including SwiftUI for building responsive UIs, @EnvironmentObject and @ObservableObject for state management, and UserDefaults for data persistence.

## Features

- **Swift**: Used for developing the application's logic.
- **SwiftUI**: For designing the user interface.
- **UserDefaults**: For persisting user data locally.
- **ObservableObject**: To manage state across views.
- **EnvironmentObject**: For sharing data between multiple views.
- **NavigationLink**: To navigate between different screens.
- **OOP**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles.

## Required Configuration

- No additional configuration is required.
